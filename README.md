# Ways to empower the community to implement Instant Answers.

## Feedback:

### 1 – Instant Answers   
This initiative [https://duck.co/ia](https://duck.co/ia) is not easy accessible from DuckDuckHack [https://duckduckhack.com](https://duckduckhack.com).

Its web page does not provide instant information to a newcomer about what is a "New Instant Answer", it also does not provide any motives to join the cause.

I found "Instant Answers" mainly targeting developers excluding a less technical audience. 

#### Suggestions:

1.1 – Improve content information on the landing page for "Instant Answers", increasing its visibility across DuckDuckHack.

1.2 – Promote genuine competition among developers, highlight the most successful "Instant Answers" and offer rewards (recognition on site, some form of profit sharing).

1.3 – Add more step by step tutorials and walk-troughs. Creating a dedicated tutorial video section.

1.4 – Allow developers to create "Instant Answers" using different programming languages, as example JavaScript/ES6, TypeScript and Node.js at the Back-End. Interesting [trends]( https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0bbxf89,%2Fm%2F0n50hxv,Babel,%2Fm%2F0j45p7w,%2Fm%2F012l1vxv).

1.5 – Introducing support for JavaScript ES6, TypeScript, React, JSX for front-end files for Spice and Goodie Instant Answers. In production, user code could be automatically transpiled using Babel.js or similar. 

1.6 –  Introducing support for automatically generated vendor prefixes for user generated CSS. In production all CSS files could be automatically prefixed, minified, simplifying the developer's job.

1.7 – Support better localization and globalization for "Instant Answers" and push DuckDuckHack internationally.
At template level, it can be achieved using a [I18n.js](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js) or [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) plugins (to be evaluated more) or a custom vanilla solution.

### 2 – Expanding "Instant Answers" to a less technical oriented audience (not only to developers).

2.1 – This can be achieved by simplifying the "Instant Answers" creation process, including the prototyping phase, using a WYSIWYG editor. Similar to online software as [webflow](https://webflow.com) or [jetstrap](https://jetstrap.com/demo).

The WYSIWYG editor could allow a user to simply select a template, connecting data sources using a UI, readjusts the size of elements and preview the result with little/no coding skills required. The WYSIWYG editor result would be a functional prototype, which could be further enhanced by coders, and included in the SERP. 

Possible variants:

2.1.1 – Simple 

The user selects from different pre-made templates and connect the template to a data source (API) using a walk-through wizard user interface.  
The number of customization is limited, no drag and drop features.

2.1.2 – Complex

The user drag and drop components and have a wide range of options at his disposal (similar to previously mentioned cloud applications).  
The number of customization is wider, drag and drop features and undo/redo could be also available.

2.2.1 – Utilizing a VPL

A VPL (visual programming language) lets users create "Instant Answers" by manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually in code, for example, using dataflow or diagrammatic programming which is based on the idea of "boxes and arrows", where boxes or other screen objects are treated as entities, connected by arrows, lines which represent relations. The output is runnable source code to be used in production.

### 3 - "Become a Leader" Initiative: 

Web Pages:

[https://duckduckhack.com](https://duckduckhack.com)

[https://forum.duckduckhack.com/t/looking-for-language-leaders/803](https://forum.duckduckhack.com/t/looking-for-language-leaders/803)

I see a lack of information on this initiative, example:
- What are the benefits for a programmer to become a "Leader"?
- What is the evaluation process?
- Who are the current leaders?

I notice also that the "Programming Mission" is currently close, but still is being empathized in the first page visible at [https://duckduckhack.com](https://duckduckhack.com).

In my opinion the "Become a Leader" initiative looks and interesting opportunity to acquire experts and at the same time to spread knowledge of DuckDuckGo mission among developers.

#### Suggestions:

3.1 – Re-open the initiative.

3.2 – Provide more information on the benefits and the evaluation process.

3.3 – Offer a "User Flair" (as narcissism motivation factor) similarly to Stack Overflow, [example](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvREI.png).

3.4 – Offer leader some sort of compensation as freebies or better visibility in the community.

3.5 – Online public voting from the community together with mini competitions could be a democratic way to select a leader.

### 4 – Open Tasks table:

The Open Tasks table visible at [https://duckduckhack.com/issues.html](https://duckduckhack.com/issues.html) contains only "Highest Impact Tasks". The tasks length listed are considerable and the page provides only a limited overview of the different tasks.

In my opinion the page is discouraging new developers to join the community (the bounce rate as analytic could be an interested value to observe).

##### Suggestions:

4.1 – A brief task overview, organized by technologies, example: tasks related to JavaScript, CSS, HTML and so on.

4.2 – Task grouping by difficulty (easy/medium/high).

Although more issues are visible in their repositories on GitHub, I think they should be organized into levels of difficulty and technologies so that newcomers know which issues would be best for them to start off with.

### 5 – DuckDuckGo API 

Across DuckDuckHack I see a lack of promotion for the DuckDuckGo API. A better promotion attracts more developers to the community and possibly more interest in the "Instant Answer" initiative. I would also add more examples of API usage to facilitate newcomers.

#### Suggestions:

5.1 – Add promotional information for DuckDuckGo API in DuckDuckHack.

5.2 – Add interactive example of API usage, similar to the API Stack Exchange, where a developer can play in real time with the API or introduce an online interpreter, similar to [Babel Repl](https://babeljs.io/repl).

5.3 – Add mini case studies of successful projects based on DuckDuckGo API to be also promoted on DuckDucHack (to inspire developers).
 
### 6 – Community promotion

#### Suggestions:

6.1 – Create and run contests to gamify the contribution process.

6.2 – Schedule online events (coding related and not) that people can join for a particular purpose.

## Feedback on DuckDuckHack current approach and process:

Technical documentation on DuckDuckHack is well done and exhaustive. Concrete examples to follow along with full explanations are provided to newcomers.

New contributors should be able to more easily start their efforts, I believe more video tutorials and grouping tickets by difficulty could be of help. 

The number of developers (data from GitHub) is interesting, still acquiring and retain active developers on the project is an important aspect.

I found in the current approach a lack of rewards to the developers for their effort within the community.

I would definitely give contributors more recognition for their time in the community.

## Contributions I would like to work on:

- *Expanding the audience for Instant Answers to wider spectrum of users.*  
I have significant experience in developing WYSIWYG editors and I believe that this effort could help to increase the number of "Instant Answers".  
I would be interested in exploring the usage of a VPL solution.

- *Allow developer to create Instant Answers using different programming language example JavaScript at the Back-End*.  
I have experience in ES6 and its related ecosystem, introducing new features of JavaScript could enrich the developers experience and interest (although I would maintain compatibility using a transpiler).

- *Improving content information on the landing page*.  
I could collaborate with your marketing and design team to enhance DuckDuckHack  communication effort with the community, taking responsibility also for code update part. 

- *Support better localization and globalization*.  
I could help with coding on localized templates with Handlebars.

- *Open Tasks table*.  
I think it is important to provide newcomers easy to use and meaningful information. I could work with your team in designing and coding a new Open Tasks table.

## Project plan:

- *Expanding the audience for Instant Answers to wider spectrum of users.*  
Work with DuckDuckGo team members (developers, product owners, UX designers) to determinate if this new feature could bring benefits and understanding all components,  including the UX aspects (time: hard to estimate 10-14 weeks for a minimal version).

- *Allow developer to create Instant Answers using different programming language example JavaScript at the Back-End*.  
Work with front and back-end developers to understand the technicality involved and implement a solution (time: hard to estimate 2-3 weeks).

- *Improving content information on the landing page*.  
Work with marketing, designer, front-end and community team leader in the creation and revision of content and editing of web pages (time: 1 week, plus some time for A/B tests).

- *Support better localization and globalization*.  
Work with front and back-end developers to understand if this feature is doable with the current infrastructure, gathering, implementation (time: hard to estimate 2 weeks).

- *Open Tasks table*.  
Work with front-end and community teams (time: 1 week, plus some time for A/B tests).

I hope to make one of these contributions reality soon!

Thanks for your time.
